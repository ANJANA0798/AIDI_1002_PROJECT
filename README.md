"Leveraging Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors for Change Point Detection in Time Series Data"

This repository demonstrates the application of **Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Change Point Detection in Time Series Data. The project explores how these two powerful machine learning algorithms can be leveraged to identify significant shifts or changes in the underlying data distribution, which is crucial in various fields such as anomaly detection, financial forecasting, and trend analysis. The repository includes code to preprocess time series data, implement both GBDT and KNN models, and evaluate their effectiveness in detecting change points. Additionally, various visualization techniques are used to highlight detected changes and compare model performance. This project serves as a valuable resource for those interested in applying advanced machine learning techniques to time series analysis and change point detection.
